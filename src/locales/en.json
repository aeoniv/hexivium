    "aboutSectionQuote": "\"Awakening the Inner Dragon\" is more than a metaphor. The dragon symbolizes the evolutionary nature of our DNA—a structure of curves, golden ratios, and rotations. Our Kung Fu practices use spiral movements to generate and channel energy, elevating states of consciousness. This approach connects to the new paradigm of sports science, which trains high-performance athletes with a focus on the fascia—the connective tissue network that integrates the entire body. By training the fascia with rotational movements, we awaken this ancestral energy for unprecedented physical and mental performance.",
