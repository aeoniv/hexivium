"gates": [1, 2, 7, 13],
"description": "You are here to follow your own lead and be in the moment. You are transfixed by the now and your way of doing things. This self absorption is your individual contribution to the world. While it is not your intention to give others direction, you do. By following your heart and doing your own expressive thing, others can find direction through your example and will follow. Do your own thing and make sure it is your passion to your core."
},
{
"name": "The Juxtaposition Cross of Self-Expression",
"gates": [1, 2, 4, 49],
"description": "Your Cross has the energy of self expression. You are here to be different and do your own thing. It is through individual expression that the rest of us can look on and adapt to the new ideas that we feel resonance with. Understand though that individualism is not always adaptive and some self expression will drive others away. It is the nature of the energy and it is not personal."
},

"gates": [1, 2, 4, 49],
"description": "Your Cross brings the energy that stands up to controlling influences. You are here to embody self expression.

You are here to make sure your expression has a voice and no one can box that in."

"gates": [2, 1, 49, 4],

"name": "The Left Angle Cross of Defiance",
"gates": [2, 1, 49, 4],
"description": "Whether conscious of this energy or not, you are here to step out of line and to represent the 'other' way of doing things. Your perceived defiance may be small or great but your goal here is to bring about variations from the norm. Most of the time this will result in slight variances coming into acceptance. This occurs not from your action but rather from the perception of your action by others."

This Cross is about living out the laws of the tribe. The lead energy has mutative qualities so there is the drive to make the laws better, but this is not revolutionary energy. The lead energy has more of a gradual change, as the law has limitations. If these limitations were to change drastically, it would feel like chaos."

"gates": [3, 50, 41, 31],
"description": "This Cross carries the energy to cause mutation or change. These changes are generally associated with rules or laws. There may be some moral judgment as any time you try to change law you may be perceived as a dissident. If you make the change from the position of power you may be perceived as being corrupt. But you are here to be a mutative force in changing the tribal rules and laws."

"gates": [4, 49, 23, 43],
"description": "Your Cross is driven by the energy of the 4th gate which is 'the answer', but this answer is really just a theory that has to be expressed and then verified. You are here to explain your theories and this is a bit of a challenge. The explanation you give will be individualistic and for a logical theory to be accepted, it needs to appeal to the collective. Your mission is to give the rest of us an uncommon explanation, one that most of us wouldn't think of."
